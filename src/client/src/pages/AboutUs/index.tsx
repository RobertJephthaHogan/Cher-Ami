                                During World War I, the lost battalion was 
                                surrounded by German soldiers in the Battle of
                                Argonne. Every carrier pigeon they sent out for help
                                was killed. Cher Ami was their last one. The lost battalion watched
                                him get shot down. All hope was lost. But somehow,
                                he took flight again and reached his destination. 
                                Saved 200 lives and was awarded the Croix de 
                                Guerre. Cher Ami means "dear friend".
